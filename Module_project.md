# Module project

I am using Oracle VM VirtualBox to make three virtual computers for a small server environment. One will be assigned to be master, and other two are minions. The operating system for the virtual computers will be Debian12 Bookworm(64).
The idea is to make a script which will install these computers, and Salt-master and Salt-minion daemons automatically. By following this report, you should be able to duplicate every single phase to make your own small virtual environment!

I use Vagrant with my hostOS, Windows. To control my virtual computers for commands, I use Vagrant SSH in Windows PowerShell.
To download and install VirtualBox and Vagrant, visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads & https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install.

## Installing the VM:s, Salt-master and Salt-minion 2.12.2024 12:45-13:50

First task is to make a new project folder for the operating system, which will contain the Vagrantfile used to install and start the Virtual Machines. This happens in my user's folder (still in HostOS).

    mkdir moduleproject
    cd moduleproject

Secondly download the image for the GuestOS used in the Virtual Machines

    vagrant init debian/bookworm64

Then to make the script for installing the three computers, Salt-master and Salt-minion and assign them as master and minions. More tips https://terokarvinen.com/2023/salt-vagrant/#infra-as-code---your-wishes-as-a-text-file.

    MASTER

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
	      config.vm.box = "debian/bookworm64"

	      config.vm.define "tminion1" do |tminion1|
	        	tminion1.vm.provision :shell, inline: $minion
	        	tminion1.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.12.100"
	        	tminion1.vm.hostname = "tminion1"
      	end

        config.vm.define "tminion2" do |tminion2|
	        	tminion2.vm.provision :shell, inline: $minion
          	tminion2.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.12.102"
	        	tminion2.vm.hostname = "tminion2"
    	end

    	config.vm.define "tmaster", primary: true do |tmaster|
        		tmaster.vm.provision :shell, inline: $master
	        	tmaster.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.12.3"
        		tmaster.vm.hostname = "tmaster"
    	end
     end

Next step was to get the machines up and running, test network and that Salt was installed properly.

First the startup. This took a few minutes, since the script installed and updated packages.

    vagrant up

Secondly tested connections and salt installations. With `ping` I tested connections from minions to master. To exit SSH, I used `exit` in the commandline.

    vagrant ssh tminion1
    ping 192.168.12.3
    sudo systemctl status salt-minion.service

    vagrant ssh tminion2
    ping 192.168.12.3
    sudo systemctl status salt-minion.service

    vagrant ssh tmaster
    sudo systemctl status salt-master.service

The result should look something like this

My master daemon was in inactive status, so I started it with next command. After this it was active.

    sudo systemctl start salt-master.service

After all this was done, it was time to accept keys for the minion-master -Salt connection with master-computer and test the connection

    sudo salt-key --list all
    sudo salt-key -A
    
    sudo salt '*' test.ping

Everything went good, and resulted in True -answers from minions.

## Installing Apache2 for master 3.12.2024 17:45-18:40

First I will install Apache2 daemon for master-computer and test it using Salt commands locally. When it's working, I will use salt to install it, and it's configuration files to minion1-computer using Salt.
To do this, I will make a module directory for this daemon "project", make a Salt statement which will install apache2, make the config files and then test that it's working. I will also make a user and user directories for using apache.
Tips: https://terokarvinen.com/2018/04/10/name-based-virtual-hosts-on-apache-multiple-websites-to-single-ip-address/, https://terokarvinen.com/2018/04/03/pkg-file-service-control-daemons-with-salt-change-ssh-server-port/?fromSearch=karvinen%20salt%20ssh & https://terokarvinen.com/2018/apache-user-homepages-automatically-salt-package-file-service-example/?fromSearch=apache

First I installed apache by hand and changed the web page to test it.

    $ master
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install apache2

    echo "Default"|sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html # is to change the localhost Default web page from Apache. Successfully
    curl localhost # returned "Default"

Then I made the apache configuration files

    $ master
    sudoedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/project1.conf

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName moduleproject.com
      ServerAlias www.moduleproject.com

              DocumentRoot /var/www/html/index.html
              <Directory /var/www/html/index.html>

                      Require all granted

              </Directory>
    </Virtualhost>

    EDITOR=micro sudoedit /var/www/html/index.html

    Try to test

Then activated the new site and restarted apache.

    sudo a2ensite project1.conf
    sudo a2dissite 000-defaul.conf
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    
    # then check if the web page changed with

    curl localhost

## Installing apache and files to master with salt 3.12.2024 18:45-
    
When the hand-installation worked, I started with Salt. First I made the directory and went inside it. Then copied the index-file I made earlier.

    $ master
    sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/apache
    cd /srv/salt/apache/

Second I made the sls file to run the commands. I Also want to make a new apacheuser1 -user for later use, so I will make it too.

    $ master
    sudoedit init.sls

   apacheuser1:
     user.present

    /srv/salt/apache/index.html:
      file.managed:
        - source: "/var/www/html/index.html"

    /srv/salt/apache/project1.conf:
      file.managed:
        - source: "/etc/apache2/sites-available/project1.conf"

    apache2:
      pkg.installed

    apache2service:
      service.running:
        - name: apache2
        - watch:
          - file: /etc/apache2/sites-available/project1.conf
          - file: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/project1.conf

Testing
    $ master
    sudo salt-call --local -l debug state.apply apache
    
End result was not what I hoped for, the service watch does not work. But otherwise, It was good so moving on.
